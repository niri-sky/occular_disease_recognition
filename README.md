## Problem Statement

This project aims to build a convolutional neural network model that analyzes fundus images of eyes to accurately categorize them as having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, or no abnormal condition.

### 1.Executive Summary

Our team set out to build a convolutional neural network that would classify healthy and non-healthy eyes based on their fundus images.

We combined datasets from several sources and preprocessed the images.




### Background

#### Eye Diseases

Ocular diseases affected over 142 million people over age 40 in the US in 2010, and that number has probably grown, according to Prevent Blindness America's website, [Vision Problems in the US](http://www.visionproblemsus.org/index.html).

#### CNN Modeling of Eye Imagery
Our team researched optimal ways to preprocess fundus images of eyes and optimal CNN architecture to get the most accurate results possible while maintaining efficiency.

In anatomy, the [fundus is the back part of any organ]('https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fundus'). For eyes, the fundus specifically refers to [the retina and other parts of the eye's back surface]('https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/fundus'). Eye doctors are able [to photograph this part of the eye](https://www.opsweb.org/page/fundusphotography) by using a specialized camera and making use of the eye's pupil, which is designed as a passage for light. Eye doctors can examine the images for signs of eye disease, but doing so requires a lot of skill. CNN models offer a way to use machine learning to detect eye disease from fundus images, potentially making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to test patients for eye disease. CNN models may also be able to detect early signs of eye disease better than eye doctors can by picking up on subtle disease patterns imperceptible to people. Detecting eye disease, and detecting it as soon as possible, significantly improves patient outcomes.
