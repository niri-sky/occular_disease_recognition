# Hotdog Not Hotdog

Your data team has decided to move outside of the consultation business and into creating it's own app! After months of brainstorming and market research you finally identify a gap in the market. You pitch the app "SeeFood" as Shazam for food to investors and are funded immediately! 

## Deliverables

* A neural net(CNN)  that can run a prediction on whether a picture contains an image of a hotdog or not. 
* A prototype Streamlit app where a user can upload a picture and have the model run a prediction. 


## Data

## Tips
* Have someone in your group immediately start the streamlit app process. You will need to find the functionality to load a model, run prediction and output that prediction. 

* Moving out of the toy dataset realm don't call your project a failure if the model has lower accuracy than you are used to. Prepare to talk about the improvement over baseline and the implications of that. 

* After you get your final model you will need to pickle it and load it into your streamlit app. While the training and preprocessing of models is going on. The individual(s) starting the streamlit process can use a prebuilt model to write code around.
