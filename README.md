### 1. <a name='exec'></a>Executive Summary

Our team set out to build a convolutional neural network that would classify healthy and non-healthy eyes based on their fundus images.

We combined datasets from several sources and preprocessed the images.




### <a name='back'></a>Background

Ocular diseases affected over 142 million people over age 40 in the US in 2010, and that number has probably grown, according to Prevent Blindness America's website, [Vision Problems in the US](http://www.visionproblemsus.org/index.html).
