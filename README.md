### 1. <a name="exec"></a>Executive Summary

Our team set out to build a convolutional neural network that would classify healthy and non-healthy eyes based on their fundus images.

We combined datasets from several sources and preprocessed the images.

We initially set out to create a multi-class model, but soon realized we needed to switch to separate binary classification models for each disease because some of the images were of eyes that had multiple diseases. This problem became apparent when early modeling showed a large degree of confusion for how to classify many of the images. After switching to binary classification models, our accuracy increased to expected levels in the 85-95% range over the course of training.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are documented and analyzed in the CNN_models folder. The [Image Augmentation CNN model used on eyes with Glaucoma](./CNN_models/CNN_image_aug_glauc.ipynb) contains detailed explanations of the techniques we used for these models, including discussions of image augmentation and CNN architecture, as well as discussions of feature maps and filters. The CNN model notebooks for [Diabetic Retinopathy](./CNN_models/CNN_image_aug_dr.ipynb), [Cataracts](./CNN_models/CNN_image_aug_cataracts.ipynb), and [a model that did not use image augmentation](./CNN_models/CNN_glaucoma_no_image_aug.ipynb) contain additional results.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models that use advanced image filters such as Gaussian are explored in the notebooks [here](.SVM_KNN_models/diabetic_gauss_SVM.ipynb), [here](.SVM_KNN_models/glaucoma_gauss_SVM.ipynb), and [here](.SVM_KNN_models/glaucoma_retinopathy_no_filter_SVM_KNN.ipynb).

A pdf of our presentation slide deck from 23 August 2021 is available in the presentation folder.

### 2. <a name="back"></a>Background

#### Eye Diseases

A study done by the CDC indicates that approximately 12 million people over the age of 40 years in the United States have vision impairment. The number includes 1 million who are blind, 3 million who have vision impairment after correction, and 8 million who have vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive error. The prevalence will more than double by 2050 due to the increase of diabetic and other chronic diseases. Currently, the economy is impacted by more than $145 billion annually because of major vision problems among the adult population over the age of 40 years. This project included models built to look at the prevalence of eye diseases across the states.

#### CNN Modeling of Eye Imagery
Our team researched optimal ways to preprocess fundus images of eyes and optimal CNN architecture to get the most accurate results possible while maintaining efficiency.

In anatomy, the [fundus is the back part of any organ]('https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fundus'). For eyes, the fundus specifically refers to [the retina and other parts of the eye's back surface]('https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/fundus'). Eye doctors are able [to photograph this part of the eye](https://www.opsweb.org/page/fundusphotography) by using a specialized camera and making use of the eye's pupil, which is designed as a passage for light. Eye doctors can examine the images for signs of eye disease, but doing so requires a lot of skill. CNN models offer a way to use machine learning to detect eye disease from fundus images, potentially making it easier, cheaper, and more efficient to test patients for eye disease. CNN models may also be able to detect early signs of eye disease better than eye doctors can by picking up on subtle disease patterns imperceptible to people. Detecting eye disease, and detecting it as soon as possible, significantly improves patient outcomes.

### 4. <a name="data"></a>Data Dictionary

This study utilized the following datasets:


#### Vision Problems Dataset

The dataset used to create choropleths and multi-classification of the vision problem prevalence came from (https://data.world/datacrunch/) with the title “Prevalence of vision problem in the US”. The datasets have non-modified eye disease features such as race, sex and age and contain more than 52,000 observations.

Description of the vision problems used in the classification models:
- Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD):   This disease happens as people get older and is a leading cause of vision loss especially among people age 50 and older.
- Glaucoma: Eye condition that damages the optic nerve by an abnormally high pressure around the eye.
- Myopia: Nearsightedness (meaning you have a difficult time seeing things far away).
- Cataract: “A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s natural lens, which lies behind the iris and the pupil.”
- Diabetic Retinopathy: A vision problem caused by chronically high blood sugar from diabetes that leads to damage to the tiny blood vessels in the retina, distorting a person's vision.
- Hyperopia: Farsightedness (meaning you have a difficult time seeing things up close)
- Vision Impairment: “A decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses.”
- Blindness: Complete inability to see light.

#### Eye Image Datasets

Image data exploration and cleaning is documented in the image_EDA_and_preprocessing folder. Image re-sizing is done in the [image preprocessing notebook](./image_EDA_and_preprocessing/image_preprocessing.ipynb).

|Dataset|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Kaggle Ocular Disease Recognition|6392 images mixed|
|Cataract Dataset|602 images mixed|
|RETINAL FUNDUS MULTI-DISEASE IMAGE DATASET|3200 images mixed|

### 5. <a name="flask"></a>Flask App
Built with:
- Python
- Java
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- HTML
- SQL
- React

#### How to run an app:
The web-site was split into two flask applications for the better memory utilization: one is the main web-site and another is the prediction application. They both communicate through rerouting. Due to GitHub storage limitations, it was not possible to load the full code into the repository and deploy on Heroku. The compressed prediction application takes up 1.2GB of memory while Heroku permits only 500 MB of memory per application, and GitHub permits 1GB of memory per repository.
Therefore, for the full code, please follow the links to the Google Cloud storage where you can download the fully functional web-site:

### 6. <a name="concl"></a>Conclusions and Recommendations

The CNN models implemented with image augmentation achieved accuracy scores on test data of 84.4% for Glaucoma, 90.6% for Diabetic Retinopathy, and 89.1% for Cataracts. These scores are not high enough for applying in a medical diagnostic setting, but show promise because the model was trained and tested with very limited data. We expect that adding more images to our training set and experimenting with image augmentation parameters would lead to higher accuracy scores that would potentially be useful for deployment to patients.

In addition, the work revealed that multi-category classification applied to public datasets had the highest accuracy (98%) using XGB classifier. The random forest model used in the classification also shows moderate performance for multi-classification of the data with 65% accuracy. The models used in the project perform as compared with 13% of the baseline of vision problems. The project successfully addressed to classify the most common eye diseases accurately.

To advance the performance of the models and make them deployable would be of great benefit to eye doctors and patients because it would allow for quick and accurate eye disease diagnosis without requiring initial analysis by an eye doctor. This would help patients get diagnosed more quickly and allow eye doctors to focus on other aspects of their practice, such as performing medical procedures and treating diseased eyes.
