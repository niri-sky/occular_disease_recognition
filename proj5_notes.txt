Some project notes:

The README should include the following (from the instructions):
-A problem statement.
-A succinct formulation of the question your analysis seeks to answer.
-A table of contents, which should indicate which notebook or scripts a stakeholder should start with, and a link to an executive summary.
-A paragraph description of the data you used, plus your data acquisition, ingestion, and cleaning steps.
-A short description of software requirements (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn) required by your analysis.


Ideas for image preprocessing:
-make sure we do the standard things (resize)
-this project on kaggle suggests subtracting the average local color from the images to improve processing time -- https://www.kaggle.com/mohammadasimbluemoon/diabeticretinopathy-messidor-eyepac-preprocessed

Ways to augment the data:
-horizontal flip
-image rotation (maybe not too much?)
- this page has some good info on using these techniques-

Feature Maps:
This page describes how to write the code to look at the feature maps made by the CNN, which would be cool to include (especially for a visual)--
